#Key design philosophies of Linux:
*Treat the user with respect
*Linux assumes you know what you are doing when you type a command and it proceeds to execute that command without asking if you really want to, giving you complete control.

#What is a VPS (Virtual Private Server)?
*Essentially, it is a computer that exists in the cloud that runs a copy of an OS, so a user can install virtually any software made for that OS on that VPS.

#Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
*You could run into a lot of security issues and also accidentally erase something because there's no prompts that will give you warnings about deleting important data.
