<h1> Cavalier King Charles Spaniel </h1>

<p>The Cavalier King Charles spaniel is my <em>favorite</em> breed of dog. I had one named Cammie for 14 years!</p>

<p>The cavalier can be one of four colors:
	<ol>
		<li>Black & tan</li>
		<li>Tricolor (black, tan & white)</li>
		<li>Blenheim (ruby & white)</li>
		<li>Ruby</li>
	</ol>
</p>
