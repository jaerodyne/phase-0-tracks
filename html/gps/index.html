  <footer>About Us</footer>

<!-- HTML5 semantic tags help to organize pages according to their content. I think the <nav> tag is really useful, as well as <main> and <article>. The order of elements on a page consists of a head, which contains the page title, followed by the body of text which the user sees. I learned about Sublime snippets in this challenge. I'm definitely going to research snippets that other people have made on the internet and think of shortcuts that I would find useful to me personally. The concept of snippets was a little hard to grasp at first, but as I said, I'll be doing more research to make sure I understand how to create ones that will speed up or improve my workflow.   -->
