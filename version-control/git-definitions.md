# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is basically the process of creating backups of your code. It's especially useful for debugging because you can always revert back to an older version if the current one has issues.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the master code that is meant for adding new features. Using a branch ensures that the master code is left untouched and changes can be made without any worries if something in the branch goes wrong.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a change to any files or directories in the repo. A good commit message is specific and explicit about what the changes actually are.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when there are discrepancies in commits from different branches and the git command doesn't know which one it should accept. It often happens when working with other developers, like when everyone edits the same line of code in a different way. It is up to the person who merges the pull request to decide which changes to use.
