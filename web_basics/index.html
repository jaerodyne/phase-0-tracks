      <h1>My Unoriginal Story</h1>
      <p>Once upon a time, in a land far, far away.</p>
      <strong>There was a boy.</strong>
      <em>Nothing special about him, but at any given time, he would have these in his pockets: </em>
      <ul>
        <li> A stick of gum </li>
        <li> His smartphone </li>
        <li> Male privilege (Start 'em young!) </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2> Things to note: </h2>
      <ol>
        <li> That was a joke. </li>
        <li> Or maybe it wasn't.</li>
        <li> But then again, if it was, it was an effective one; the truth hurts because it's too real, and it's kinda funny if you have a dark sense of humor. </li>
      </ol>
      <p> Clearly, I'm jaded. </p>
