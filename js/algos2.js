// write a function that takes an array of words and returns the longest word
// store current count in a variable
// store current word in a variable
// while i is less than the array length
// iterate through array and count the length of each word
// if length of current word is shorter than the next word, next word becomes the current word and current word length is logged in count
// else, break loop
